# Redash Add-On - LLM Chatbot for Advanced Analytics and Visualization

## Introduction
Welcome, team! We're excited to embark on the Redash Add-On - LLM Chatbot project together. Our objective is to build a novel Redash chat add-on that enables users to extract insights from multiple Redash dashboards and connected databases using natural language. This chatbot add-on will facilitate seamless conversation in a question and answer format, allowing users to autonomously discover knowledge and obtain deep, meaningful, and actionable insights from business intelligence (BI) platforms.
